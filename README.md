# Store-Sales-Analysis_Dashboard (Excel)
##Project Objective
This project is a Sales Performance Dashboard for "Snappit," a retail or grocery business. It is designed to monitor and analyze key sales metrics across various outlets, product types, and locations. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights into the company's performance, helping management identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement to drive business growth.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Retail businesses often manage vast amounts of sales data from different stores and product categories, making it challenging to get a clear, consolidated view of performance. Without an effective analytical tool, it's difficult to identify which outlets are performing best, what products are most popular, and how regional factors impact sales.

This Snappit Sales Dashboard solves this problem by centralizing all key sales data into a single, interactive interface, enabling quick analysis and informed strategic decision-making.
